# OxyIPS
An IPS patching utility written in Rust. It only applies patches, it can't make them.
This is my first practical Rust program so it's kind of shitty.
It might act weird when presented with horribly malformed IPS files, but what program doesn't.

Usage: OxyIPS [patch file] [file you want to patch] [output]
